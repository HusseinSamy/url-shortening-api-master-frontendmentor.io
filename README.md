# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](./assets/design/desktop-preview.jpg)
## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
- The `input` field is empty

## My feedback on the challenge
This is my first challenge on [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G), and it was so much fun working on it. 

[This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?pli=1) extension really helped me in creating a 99% percent accurate design.

Feel free to clone the project and take a look on the source code, and I am open for any discussion/reviews on it!ðŸš€
